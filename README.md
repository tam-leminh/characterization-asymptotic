## Requirements

No additional packages are required to reproduce the article figures.

If you want to **regenerate simulation data**, see comments in the code. Some parts use a parallel computing library, which is not technically required.

## Reproducing figures

To reproduce all figures from the article, run the R script in the base directory:
```r
source("script.R")
